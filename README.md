Anchor Extension Icons
======================

CSS added extension icons to your anchor link. The styling is left very basic in order to be modified easily to fit your theme.


Installation
---

Include the CSS stylesheet: `anchor-extension-icons.css`.

**Example**: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="yourpath/anchor-extension-icons.css">`

Usage
---
Just link your anchors like you normally would. If it ends in a supported extension the CSS will automatically append the icon.

**Example**: `<a href="example.doc">Microsoft Word Document</a>`
